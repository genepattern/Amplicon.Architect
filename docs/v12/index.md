# Ordering of arguments: 

If a bam file is provided, then the order of the arguments should be:
````
sample name, 
number of threads, 
genome reference, 
if bam file is provided ( in this case, "Yes"), 
bam filepath, 
run AA or not ( "Yes" or "No"), 
run AC or not ("Yes" or "No), 
ploidy (-1 as default, indicating that it won't be included), 
purity (-1 as default, indicating that it won't be included), 
cnv kit segment (none as default), bed file path
````

An example is: 
```bash run_paa.sh FF-1 4 GRCh38 Yes /path/to/bamfile Yes Yes -1 -1 none```

If a bam file is not provided: 
````
sample name, 
number of threads, 
genome reference, 
if bam file is provided ( in this case, "No"), 
fastq1 file path, fastq2 file path, 
run AA or not ( "Yes" or "No"), 
run AC or not ("Yes" or "No"), 
ploidy (-1 as default, indicating that it won't be included), 
purity (-1 as default, indicating that it won't be included), 
cnv kit segment (none as default), 
bed file path
````
